# cleandl

 A simple script I use to clean up my messy Downloads folder. It moves files into their proper places (Pictures, Videos, Documents, etc.). Made for my Linux setup, I hope it also works in yours too. 

# Installation guide

Just copy this
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uberblatt/cleandl/main/install | bash
